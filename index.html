    <h1>All Star Lyrics</h1>
    <p>Somebody bonce told me, "the world is gonna roll" me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
        She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shaoe of an 'L' on her forehead.
        Well, they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
        Didn't make sense so I did it for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
        So much to do, so much to say so what's wrong with taking the backstreets.
        You never know if you don't go. You never shine if you don't glow.
